# JavaFX Skeleton App

A simple template for JavaFX application built around:

- Java 11
- OpenJFX 12 (binaries not part of this project)
- Weld 3 (CDI implementation)
- Maven 3

## Why?

Quickly bootstrap your JavaFX application using standard tools and libraries. Most of the time you would need to set this up anyway. JavaFX is not dead, so you never know when you need it ;).

## How?

1. [Install JDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/)
2. [Install OpenJFX](https://openjfx.io/)
3. Clone this project and run `mvn package`
4. Adjust as you wish.
